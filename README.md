# Face Recognition for Employee Attendance System

This project focuses on developing a face recognition system for employee attendance tracking. It was undertaken during an internship at PT. Media Kode Indonesia from February to March 2024. The project utilizes the DeepFace and OpenCV libraries. We employed the Facenet-512 model for face recognition and the FastMTCNN model for object detection. Additionally, Streamlit was used as the user interface.
